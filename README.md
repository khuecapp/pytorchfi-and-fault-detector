# 🧪 Fault Injection & Detection Experiments using PyTorchFI

This repository contains example code and experiments for testing **fault detection algorithms** using **PyTorchFI**, a fault-injection framework for PyTorch-based neural networks.

The main purpose of this repo is to:

- Inject **neuron-level** or faults into CNN models  
- Evaluate the **detection accuracy** of custom fault detectors  
- Provide demo scripts and utilities for quick experimentation

## 📌 Features

- Simple CNN models for demonstration  
- Support for single-bit and multi-bit **neuron fault injection**  
- Automatic **fault detection** using hooks  
- Utilities for evaluating:
  - Detected faults (TP)
  - False negatives (FN)
  - False positives (FP)
  - Fault detection Rate
- Ready-to-run experiment demo script
